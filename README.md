### Project Title: **Building a Llama 3-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System in Google Colab**

#### Project Summary:
This project focuses on setting up a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using Llama 3, LangChain, ChromaDB, and Gradio in a Google Colab environment. The goal of the project is to combine a language model (Llama 3) with a retrieval mechanism to improve the accuracy and contextual relevance of responses. By integrating web data and creating a streamlined Gradio interface, this system allows users to ask questions about a provided context and receive relevant answers based on real-time document retrieval and language generation.

#### Key Components:
1. **Llama 3 Language Model**: Serves as the primary model for generating contextually relevant responses.
2. **LangChain**: Provides tools for handling large language model applications, document loading, and processing.
3. **ChromaDB**: Stores and retrieves embedded text data, enabling the RAG setup.
4. **Gradio**: A user-friendly interface for querying the system.
5. **Google Colab**: An accessible environment for executing the project without needing specialized hardware or paid APIs.

#### Main Goal:
The main objective of this project is to build an effective RAG system that utilizes Llama 3 for real-time data retrieval and response generation, allowing for meaningful question-answer interactions on specified contexts. This setup helps harness web data and facilitates efficient querying through a simple Gradio interface.
